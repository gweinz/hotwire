		Hotwire
	</h3>

	<p>
		The person playing this card asks the group where the NFL player on the card went to college. DO NOT SHOW THE OTHER PLAYERS THE CARD. First person to get it right gets to keep the card and thus gain the points. We recommend limiting one guess per person per card and to have people raise hands to establish a queue of answering. Answer is on the bottom.

	<p>
		Place the card face up in the middle of the table. Starting with the person playing the card go around in a clockwise motion naming current NFL players from the school that is on the card. The first person to mess up or be wrong keeps the card.
